/*
 * Write a method named numUnique that takes three integers as parameters and that 
 * returns the number of unique integers among the three. For example, the call numUnique(18, 3, 4) 
 * should return 3 because the parameters have 3 different values. By contrast, the call numUnique(6, 7, 6) 
 * would return 2 because there are only 2 unique numbers among the three parameters: 6 and 7.
